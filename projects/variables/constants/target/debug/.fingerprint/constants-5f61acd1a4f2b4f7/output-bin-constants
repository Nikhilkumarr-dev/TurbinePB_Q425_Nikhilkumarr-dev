{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"use of mutable static is unsafe and requires unsafe block","code":{"code":"E0133","explanation":"Unsafe code was used outside of an unsafe block.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0133\nunsafe fn f() { return; } // This is the unsafe code\n\nfn main() {\n    f(); // error: call to unsafe function requires unsafe function or block\n}\n```\n\nUsing unsafe functionality is potentially dangerous and disallowed by safety\nchecks. Examples:\n\n* Dereferencing raw pointers\n* Calling functions via FFI\n* Calling functions marked unsafe\n\nThese safety checks can be relaxed for a section of the code by wrapping the\nunsafe instructions with an `unsafe` block. For instance:\n\n```\nunsafe fn f() { return; }\n\nfn main() {\n    unsafe { f(); } // ok!\n}\n```\n\nSee the [unsafe section][unsafe-section] of the Book for more details.\n\n#### Unsafe code in functions\n\nUnsafe code is currently accepted in unsafe functions, but that is being phased\nout in favor of requiring unsafe blocks here too.\n\n```\nunsafe fn f() { return; }\n\nunsafe fn g() {\n    f(); // Is accepted, but no longer recommended\n    unsafe { f(); } // Recommended way to write this\n}\n```\n\nLinting against this is controlled via the `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` lint, which\nis `warn` by default in the 2024 edition and `allow` by default in earlier\neditions.\n\n[unsafe-section]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":72,"byte_end":76,"line_start":3,"line_end":3,"column_start":28,"column_end":32,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    println!(\"the data is {DATA}\")","highlight_start":28,"highlight_end":32}],"label":"use of mutable static","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"mutable statics can be mutated by multiple threads: aliasing violations or data races will cause undefined behavior","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0133]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: use of mutable static is unsafe and requires unsafe block\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0msrc/main.rs:3:28\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m3\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    println!(\"the data is {DATA}\")\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m                            \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9muse of mutable static\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mnote\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: mutable statics can be mutated by multiple threads: aliasing violations or data races will cause undefined behavior\u001b[0m\n\n"}
